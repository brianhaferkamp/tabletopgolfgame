- [Game guide](https://raw.github.com/brianhaferkamp/tabletopgolfgame/main/golf_game_guide.pdf)

For detailed instructions on how to play, please download and read the game guide. You will need at least 2 d6 dice to play but 4 d6 dice are recommended. Each pair of dice should be distinguishable from the other pair (different color probably works best).

Choose a player to play a round with. You can play solo or against 1-3 other players.

The basic game play is to roll 1 or 2 pairs of d6 dice for each shot. Start with the Tee shot on each hole then move to the Approach shot (where necessary). If there is a necessity to hit a short wedge or chip shot then use the Wedge/Chip grid on each player's card. All putting is done from the player's card.

It is advised not to add any advanced features of the game--wind, player attributes, penalty shots, etc.--until you have a good grasp on the mechanics of the game. By the time you end your first 9 holes, you're probably ready to layer in the more advanced elements of the game.

If you have any questions or concerns first read through the game guide. If there are still things you don't understand send an email with your questions or concerns to onbasebaseball@gmail.com. 

Thanks for trying out the game. Any feedback you have is certainly appreciated. Please play a couple of rounds and then send your thoughts and/or ideas to onbasebaseball@gmail.com.
