- [Player cards](https://raw.github.com/brianhaferkamp/tabletopgolfgame/main/golf_game_player_cards.pdf)
- [Game guide](https://raw.github.com/brianhaferkamp/tabletopgolfgame/main/golf_game_guide.pdf)

For detailed instructions on how to play, please download and read the game guide. You will need at least 2 d6 dice to play but 4 d6 dice are recommended. Each pair of dice should be distinguishable from the other pair (different color probably works best).
