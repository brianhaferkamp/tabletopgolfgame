# Tabletop Golf Game

This is the demo for a new tabletop golf game. To play the game, download and print these components:

- Course (9 holes for the demo)
- Player cards
- Game guide

For detailed instructions on how to play, please download and read the game guide. You will need at least 2 d6 dice to play but 4 d6 dice are recommended. Each pair of dice should be distinguishable from the other pair (different color probably works best).
